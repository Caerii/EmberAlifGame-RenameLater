# Ideas Design Document

catalogue of flawed agents- algorithmically constrained (seed-based? genetics?), messy priors, invalid deduction rules

do they even use language? maybe their communication is simply emergent from their behavior

Dynamics of interactions
    - 

Controling agents? Swarms of agents? Use our agents to beat their agents?

Fungus mycelial evolution growth game, merge with different constructs, become a mushroom God??
 
  (eventually, a crab mushroom god)

Cell recombination + growth mechanics? 

Particle simulator (https://particle-love.com/), but instead of particles, it's arbitrary 3D agents that you can spawn into the world, and they have certain proclivities,
    you can add radiation and give them entertainment, and keep growing them. Maybe they require resources to live and you need to feed them?
    
Time travel sandbox?

Cell to Singularity game but more fun? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_to_Singularity

Strategy simulation game? Maybe you are a powerful AI that is undergoing a hard takeoff? Maybe like a more modernized version of this? The game could be about the evolution of technology + expand tech trees. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endgame:_Singularity (- Reminds me of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plague_Inc:_Evolved)
    - Reasons this would be interesting:
        - We could add elements that are exotic and SCP-like that the AI harnesses
        - We could add our own spin to the diffusion of processes
        - We could experiment with ways that the AI could manipulate the society
        - Philosophical explorations of certain kinds of tech-tree advancements
    - What if we make it turn-based, where there are the HUMANS and the AI. One person represents all humans, the other represents AI.
        - This could mean the humans could make policies to prevent certain kinds of usages of AI, so it closes off certain possibilities for the player playing "as the AI" so to speak.
    - Two parallel-ish games, that interact at various points (human policies limit certain AI options, certain AI options make humans aware / give them new capabilities, etc)
    - Mode where humans and AI can merge, perhaps interesting gameplay elements from this?

Alien Invasion type thing? (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destroy_All_Humans!)
    - Humans get invaded by an external species

Fake Internet, where all of the contents are synthesized, you can buy fake items etc.

Generative Simulacra based games
    - Use multimodal AI and represent the entire state of the game with a large context length

Humans in a Box
    Grow your humans, give them FOOD, TV, keep them entertained and confused in order to get more computational resources.

List of cool game mechanics:
    - Cool environmental effects
    - Smart procedural stuff, where it's more interesting than just algorithmic
    - Upload a scan of an object and it becomes Alive, sorta like scribblenauts, but like, world objects.
    - Ways of evolving (upgrades)
